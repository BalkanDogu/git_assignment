Answers

a. What is an issue?
GitHub Issues allows you to track text-based descriptions of tasks, bugs, changes, and updates in your software development project. It is used to keep track of work, give or receive feedback, and get help from others by discussing ideas and getting them to contribute. 
In short, if you need help about the project you are working on, you use this tool.

b. What is a pull request?
It allow you to contribute to other projects. Pull Requests (PR) let you tell others about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. You create a proposal using a pull request but these changes can be just in a branch not in the main.

c. How do I open up a pull request?
First of all, you should Fork and copy the Repositories to be used in your own GitHub account. Then you need to create a branch. After progressing in the project, we make a Pull Request to send these changes. We need to tab “Pull requests” then “Campare &pull request”. We have to choose our own repository as a base and compare part you have to see the name of the brunch. After that, we have to push “Create Pull Request”. That is all.

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.
First, a new Repository is created in your own GitHub account. Then that Repository opens. In the menu bar, there is “SETTINGS”, opening Settings on the left side there is “MANAGE ACCESS” and you can see in the middle of the page the “INVITE A COLLABORATOR” button. From the page that opens, you can search and invite people by username or e-mail. Once the people you invite confirm their e-mail, they become available.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a version control system and allows you to make changes on your local computer. GitHub, on the other hand, is a control system that allows you to perform the same operation on the internet, that is, in the claud environment.

f. What does git diff do?
Shows changes between the current file and the newly submitted file. It shows the change between the project on the local computer and the project on GitHub.

What is the main branch?
It is the place where the final information about the project is sent and combined from the branches created within the scope of the project.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
Doing this is out of the question. However, when we make progress on the project, we send a pull request to the main branch to be accepted the changes. Only if the project manager accepts the changes will be transferred to the main branch.
