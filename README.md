Answers

a. What is an issue?
GitHub Issues allows you to track text-based descriptions of tasks, bugs, changes, and updates in your software development project. It is used to keep track of work, give or receive feedback, and get help from others by discussing ideas and getting them to contribute. 
In short, if you need help about the project you are working on, you use this tool.

b. What is a pull request?
It allow you to contribute to other projects. Pull Requests (PR) let you tell others about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. You create a proposal using a pull request but these changes can be just in a branch not in the main.
