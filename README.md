Answers

a. What is an issue?
GitHub Issues allows you to track text-based descriptions of tasks, bugs, changes, and updates in your software development project. It is used to keep track of work, give or receive feedback, and get help from others by discussing ideas and getting them to contribute. 
In short, if you need help about the project you are working on, you use this tool.

b. What is a pull request?
It allow you to contribute to other projects. Pull Requests (PR) let you tell others about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. You create a proposal using a pull request but these changes can be just in a branch not in the main.

c. How do I open up a pull request?
First of all, you should Fork and copy the Repositories to be used in your own GitHub account. Then you need to create a branch. After progressing in the project, we make a Pull Request to send these changes. We need to tab “Pull requests” then “Campare &pull request”. We have to choose our own repository as a base and compare part you have to see the name of the brunch. After that, we have to push “Create Pull Request”. That is all.

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.
First, a new Repository is created in your own GitHub account. Then that Repository opens. In the menu bar, there is “SETTINGS”, opening Settings on the left side there is “MANAGE ACCESS” and you can see in the middle of the page the “INVITE A COLLABORATOR” button. From the page that opens, you can search and invite people by username or e-mail. Once the people you invite confirm their e-mail, they become available.
